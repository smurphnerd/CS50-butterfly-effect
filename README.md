# My final project for harvard's CS50 course.

For this project, I decided to make a website where you can make your own data tree which is visualised as a tree view. I made this because I often get lost in thinking about how different choices that I make can lead to various different consequences and wanted to have something to visualise that in a cool way.
However, this website could be used for a variety of different things as well such as:

- family trees,
- writing pseudocode,
- choose your own adventures, and
- anything else you can imagine.

The website comes with a database that stores different users and their trees so that you can save your work for later.

Overall, I'm pretty happy how the website turned out - the design is largely inspired by VScode's dark theme. In the future, I would like to add more pages that allow users to visualise their trees graphically.
