# The butterfly effect

## Introduction

This is my final project for harvard's CS50 course.
For this project, I decided to make a website where users can make their own data tree and visualise it as a tree view.
This program could be used for a variety of different purposes such as:

- planning the future,
- making family trees,
- writing pseudocode,
- making choose your own adventures, and
- anything else you can imagine.

## Technologies

### Backend

#### Flask

By running [app.py](/app.py)

- Sqlite3
  The website comes with a database that stores different users and their trees so that you can save your work for later.

Overall, I'm pretty happy how the website turned out - the design is largely inspired by VScode's dark theme. In the future, I would like to add more pages that allow users to visualise their trees graphically.
